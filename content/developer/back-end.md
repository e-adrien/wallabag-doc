## Tips for back-end developers

### Use PHP’s built-in web server

[PHP’s built-in web server](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php) allows you to develop without installing a web server like Nginx or Apache.

To install PHP dependencies, build the `dev` version of the front-end, configure wallabag, and start the built-in server, run:

```
make dev
```

Note that you will need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) to build the front-end `dev` version.

### Linting

To make your code conform to wallabag's code style, run:

```
php bin/php-cs-fixer fix --verbose
```
