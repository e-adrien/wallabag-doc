The main purpose of wallabag is to save web articles. You have many ways
to do it. If you think that the article is wrongly displayed,
[you can read this documentation]({{<relref "../errors_during_fetching.md" >}}).

## By using a bookmarklet

There is the `How-to` page. You can find this page as entry in the top
right menu named `Your Account`. There you have got a `Add Link` tab.
Almost at the bottom you can find the `bag it!` link. Drag and drop this
link to your bookmarks bar of your browser.

Now, each time you're reading an article on the web and you want to save
it, click on the `bag it!` link in your bookmarks bar. The article is
saved.

## By using the classic form

In the top bar of your screen, you have 3 icons. With the first one, a
plus sign, you can easily save a new article.

![Top bar](../../../img/user/topbar.png)

Click on it to display a new field, paste the article URL inside and
press your `Return` key. The article is saved.

## By using a browser add-on

### Firefox

You can download the [Firefox addon

### How to use our addon

wallabagger is a browser extension to add pages to wallabag, with the ability to:

- save current page
- edit title
- add (with autocomplete!) and remove tags
- set starred and archived
- delete

#### Options

First of all you have to create a new client on your wallabag installation. How to do that is described in that part of the [documentation]({{< relref "/developer/api/oauth/#creating-a-new-api-client" >}}).

What we need from that client is two strings: Client ID and Client secret.

   ![Client](../../../img/user/wallabagger/opt-client.png)

##### Access options page

After the installation of Wallabagger extension you can setup it by going to the options page. This page is accessible by

- Right click on extension icon and choose menu "options"

   ![Menu](../../../img/user/wallabagger/opt-menu.png)

- Go to your Chromium-based browser [extension setup page](chrome://extensions), and click on the "options" link in the Wallabagger section

   ![extensions](../../../img/user/wallabagger/opt-ext-optlink.png)

##### Setup process

- Enter the URL of your wallabag installation (without "http://" ), check "https" if you use that, and click "Check URL" button

   ![URL](../../../img/user/wallabagger/opt-url.png)

   if the URL is valid then in checklist in the bottom of page will be information about that.

   ![checklist](../../../img/user/wallabagger/opt-checklist.png)

- If the URL was checked and a correct api is found, then the client and user credential fields appears. Fill them and click the "Get token" button. From now access token will be fetched authomatically, when it expires.

   ![Client fields](../../../img/user/wallabagger/opt-clientfields.png)

    if the credentials are correct you'll see it in the checklist with an information about that.

   ![Token granted](../../../img/user/wallabagger/opt-granted.png)

- If you have tags including spaces, check appropriate options. This will toggle the ending tag key from Space to Enter

##### Security warning

In this version of the extension your password is stored in the browser local storage as a plain text and could be retrieved by anyone with access to your computer. The password encryption will be implemented in future versions.
