Congratulations, you're now logged into your new wallabag account.

## Homepage

Here is an overview of the homepage:

![Homepage](../../img/user/wallabag_interface_homepage.png)

Your saved articles will appear on ①, whether in a grid or a list view.

On the left ② is the menu with the list of unread, starred, archived articles and your tags.

On the top right ③ is the main toolbar.

## Toolbar

![Toolbar](../../img/user/wallabag_interface_toolbar.png)

Buttons on ① and ② are respectively for saving a new url and searching through your saved entries.

Button ③ is for quickly opening a random saved entry.

Button ④ is for showing the filter modal.

Button ⑤ is for downloading articles from the current view.

Button ⑥ is for showing the account menu.

## Filter modal

![Filter modal](../../img/user/wallabag_interface_filter.png)

This modal lets you filter entries using more criterias than the main text search, including:

- whether articles are unread, starred, archived or contain annotations
- the language of the articles
- the reading time of the articles
- the domain name
- the date when the article has been saved

Click on the _Filter_ button to validate your criterias.

## Account menu

![Account Menu](../../img/user/wallabag_interface_account_menu.png)

Clicking on the avatar button will show you the account menu, which lets you go
to your configuration page, manage your API clients (_e.g. for a mobile app or
wallabagger_) and choose between light and dark themes.

Go to the dedicated [configuration]({{< relref "configuration/" >}}) doc for more detail about your account settings.

If you are an administrator of the instance, this menu will also let you manage
users and internal settings.
