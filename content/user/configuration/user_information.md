On this page you can change your name, your email address and enable two-factor
authentication.

If the wallabag instance has more than one enabled user, you can delete
your account here. **Take care, we delete all your data**.

## Two factor authentication (2FA)

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**For administrators**: enabling 2FA from the configuration interface is only
possible if it has been authorized before in `app/config/parameters.yml`
by setting the `twofactor_auth` parameter to `true` (do not forget to run
`php bin/console cache:clear --env=prod` after modification).
{{< /callout >}}

Two-factor authentication (_also known as 2FA, MFA or multi-factor
authentication_) is a security measure that strengthens identification of users
by a combination of different components.

On wallabag you can either use one-time code sent by email or one-time codes
generated by an OTP app (_e.g. Google Authenticator, Aegie, FreeOTP_).

{{< callout type="info" >}}
We strongly recommend to prefer the use of an OTP app than the one-time code sent by email.

Once 2FA is enabled on your account, each time you want to login to wallabag,
you'll be required to enter a one-time code after submitting your password. You
have to put this code on the following form.

If you don't want to receive a code each time you want to login, you can
check the `I'm on a trusted computer` checkbox: wallabag will remember
you for 15 days.

### Enable 2FA using OTP app

Once you click on _Use OTP_ wallabag will show the configuration page for OTP app.

![2FA configuration](../../../img/user/wallabag_config_2fa_otp.png)

Then you should scan the image using your OTP app. If the image is not shown or
if you can't scan it, you can enter the secret printed below the image.

wallabag will also give you a list of backup codes, you must save them in case
you lose access to your OTP app.

You will be prompted to enter a one-time code to validate the activation of 2FA.
